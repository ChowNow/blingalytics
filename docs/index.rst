Blingalytics
============

Blingalytics is an open-source Python project for building a flexible,
powerful business reporting system.

* Define new reports quickly by writing simple Python

* Pluggable data source and caching structure â€” use the built-in modules or
  write one for your own particular needs

* Output your report data to powerful HTML/JavaScript tables, with paging,
  sorting and more

Thanks to Adly_ for fostering the development of Blingalytics as an
open-source project.
